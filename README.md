# Operating System Lab Assignments

This repository contains weekly lab assignments for the Shell Scripting course for BTech 3rd year CSE. Each directory corresponds to a specific week's assignment, with the associated scripts and documentation.


## Code Editor


To work with the scripts in this repository, it's recommended to use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VS Code provides a powerful and user-friendly environment for editing and debugging shell scripts.

### Installation

1. **Download VS Code:**

   - Go to the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
   - Choose the version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the installer.

2. **Install VS Code:**

   - **Windows:** Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - **macOS:** Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag the VS Code icon to the Applications folder.
   - **Linux:** Follow the instructions on the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) for your specific Linux distribution.

3. **Setup VS Code for Shell Scripting:**

   - **Install Shell Script Extensions:**
     - Open VS Code.
     - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
     - Search for and install the following extensions:
       - **Shell Script**: Provides syntax highlighting and other features for shell scripting.
       - **Bash IDE**: Adds advanced features like code linting and debugging support.

   - **Configure VS Code for Shell Scripting:**
     - Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
     - Type `Shell Script` and select `Shell Script: Create New Shell Script` to set up your workspace for shell scripting.

4. **Optional: Install Additional Tools**

   - You might also want to install additional tools or extensions based on your specific needs. For more information, refer to the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).


## Git Bash (Recommended)


For an enhanced shell scripting experience, it is recommended to use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/), which provides a Unix-like shell environment on Windows.

### Installation

1. **Download Git Bash:**

   - Go to the [Git for Windows download page](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - The download should start automatically. If not, click on the provided link to manually download the installer.

2. **Install Git Bash:**

   - **Windows:**
     - Run the downloaded installer (`Git-<version>-<arch>.exe`).
     - Follow the installation prompts. You can generally accept the default settings, but make sure to choose "Git Bash Here" during the installation process for easier access to Git Bash from the context menu.

3. **Setup Git Bash:**

   - **Basic Configuration:**
     - Open Git Bash by searching for it in the Start menu or right-clicking in a directory and selecting “Git Bash Here.”
     - You can customize your Git Bash environment by editing the `.bashrc` file located in your home directory (`~`).

   - **Optional: Install Additional Tools**
     - You might want to install additional tools or extensions depending on your needs. For example, you can install Git-related tools or utilities that enhance your scripting experience.

4. **Using Git Bash:**

   - To run a shell script, navigate to the directory containing your script and execute it with the following command:
   
     ```bash
     bash script_name.sh
     ```

   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script. You can modify the permissions using:

     ```bash
     chmod +x script_name.sh
     ```
